        </div>
        <p>My name is Offiaukwu Chidubem Festus JNR, I'm a 16-year-old Techie, i hail from Enugu state,Nigeria.
            I started coding at the age of 15, i don't have much experience.<br>
            So what got me interested was just looking at a friend of mine during ICT
            class using this app VS CODE, i asked him what he was doing and he told me making a website and i was
            anxious cause i never taught it was possible for someone at that level to be able to make website, so i told
            him to tell me more about it and he did, he also gave me a video which teaches more about HTML5, CSS3 and
            JAVASCRIPT, i watched the video and i was so interested in it, so i started learning it and i have been
            learning it for some months now and i have made a lot of progress. I am still a student and i am still
            learning
            more about coding and i hope to be a professional coder in the future. I am also a soccer player and i love
            Basketball.
            I love solving problems and i value friends. I am a very friendly person and i love making new friends.
            <br><br>
            Along this journey i met a friend who is a professional in coding and he has been helping me a lot in my
            coding journey.
            I am very grateful to him and i hope to be like him in the future. <br>
            so at this stage i know how to create a website using HTML5, CSS3 and a bit of java script, i also know how
            to deploy a website using github.
